Ingwi IT Standards are corporate documents from the fab CIO defining the premises on how Ingwi systems should be managed. 

All CIO Standards now follow a Risk, Policy, Control format to define each requirement.
Deviations to each element in a Standard must be documented in the [WWBCIT] [WWBCIT] tool.  The process for creating and submitting a deviation for approval is [here] [here]

- **Risk** -- What is the risk that this element covers? Example: By not having capacity management processes, the system may run slow at critical times of month/year. 

- **Policy** -- Capacity Management must be done, on an ongoing basis.

- **Control** -- Report, preferably automated, must be created frequently, and reported to the Application Squad

- **Additional Control Statement** -- Documented proof of frequent review and resulting decisions, must be kept. 

Note - That this policy does not state the frequency, format, tools or other implementation detail.  That is for the owning Squad.
